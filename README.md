# Programming competition reference document

This document contains useful algorithms to use during a programming competition, in a compact format. Before using this check:
- You are allowed to use a reference document (at all).
- Are allowed to bring 25 pages of text.
- If the pages should be printed single-sided (or not), and how many copies you are allowed to use.
- If Images/figures are allowed in the reference document.
- The minimum text size required for the document to be allowed.
- Are you allowed to use colors in the document?
- Will you use the same version of C++? Or use C++ at all?
You may need to edit the reference document yourself accordingly!

## How to compile and customize

The reference document can be compiled with LaTeX from the `main.tex` file. Note that you may need to install extra LaTeX packages when generating the file yourself. The `minted` package is required.

To modify the names and other specific information, edit the `config.tex` file. The logo displayed on the front page can be changed by changing the `logo.png` file. If you want to change the content of the reference document, change the `content.tex` file, which contains most of the text in the document. The `main.tex` file contains package information, configurations, and the front page content.
